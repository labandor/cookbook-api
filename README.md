# Lord of the Chefs API

This is an API created with the idea of creating a site to be able to find recipes for those days where you lack inspiration. A space for people to share their creations and leave feedback of their own experiences. Cooking can be hard. Why not make it just that little bit easier.

Using this API you will be able to access a wide variety of recipes via different queries as well as categorizations. We plan to create many different end points to create a robust and strong API.
